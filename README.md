# Clustering-in-R
Problem Statement:
Perform Unsupervised learning using K-Means Clustering

Approach:
The data is of players gameplay. Using it to for clusters of players for providing custom benefits to players.
The following code will help in performing unsupervised learning to create segments in data using K-Means Clustering.
The data is first preprocessed and K-Means clustering is performed on the standard Features. 
Later Principal component Analysis is applied to the features and consequently K-Means is applied on the new features yielded out of PCA.
